      # This step generates artifact attestations, which are important for verifying the integrity and authenticity of the artifacts produced by the workflow.
      # Artifact attestations provide a way to ensure that the artifacts have not been tampered with and are produced by a trusted source.
      # This is crucial for maintaining security and trust in the software supply chain, especially when distributing packages to end users or other systems.
